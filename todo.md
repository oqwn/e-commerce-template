# E-Commerce Platform Development Roadmap

## Project Overview

This TODO list is organized by development phases, prioritizing MVP features first, then progressive enhancement based on the user stories. Each item includes priority levels and estimated effort.

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-21

**Current Status**: The project has been converted from a trading engine to a clean e-commerce template. We have inherited a solid infrastructure foundation:

**✅ Already Implemented**:
- Spring Boot 3.x backend with clean `com.ecommerce` package structure
- React 18+ frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Docker containers (dev/prod) with health checks and multi-arch builds
- MySQL database with Flyway migrations and setup scripts
- Redis for caching and session storage
- Prometheus + Grafana monitoring stack
- Environment-based configurations
- Build automation with Maven and pnpm
- Code quality tools (Checkstyle, PMD, SpotBugs, ESLint)
- Comprehensive Makefile for development commands
- **Complete CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions (testing, security scanning, deployments)
- Security scanning with Trivy
- Code coverage reporting with Codecov
- **JWT-based authentication** with login/logout functionality
- **User registration** with email verification endpoints
- **Role-based access control** (BUYER/SELLER/ADMIN)
- **User profile management** with update capabilities
- **Address management system** with full CRUD operations
- **Password reset functionality** (endpoints ready)

**Priority Levels**:
- 🔥 **Critical** - MVP blockers
- ⭐ **High** - Core functionality
- 📈 **Medium** - Enhancement features
- 🚀 **Low** - Advanced features

**Effort Estimation**:
- **S** (Small): 1-3 days
- **M** (Medium): 1-2 weeks  
- **L** (Large): 2-4 weeks
- **XL** (Extra Large): 1+ months
